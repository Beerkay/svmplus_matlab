An implementation of SVM+ with MATLAB QP solver. It has also been tested with MOSEK QP solver. 

A faster implementation of kernel SVM+ based on a new SVM+ formulation is also released. You need libsvm to run it.

If you feel it is useful, please cite the following papers:

Wen Li, Dengxin Dai, Mingkui Tan, Dong Xu, and Luc Van Gool, “Fast Algorithms for Linear and Kernel SVM+,” IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition(CVPR),2016

For any question, please contact Wen Li via liwenbnu@gmail.com.
